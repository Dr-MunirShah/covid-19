# How data science can help in contact tracking covid-19 cases?

Countries around the world are handling covid-19 pandemic in a variety of ways. Some of them are proactive and others more reactive. However, the successful are the ones who are proactive in doing comprehensive, in-depth and early contact tracking and investigation of every probable case. This allowed them to find and quarantine people that might have been exposed to the covid-19.  South Korea and Singapore are examples where comprehensive tracking and surveillance is proving a very effective tool in reducing the spread of covid-19. Singapore gave a new meaning to disease detectives, they mobilized cops & a network of thousands of public cameras to retrace the footsteps of patients, hunting down those they were in contact with.

Data scientists are contributing in understanding the immediate impacts and future by scenario simulations and comparisons.  In my view, we have much more to offer especially in helping decision makers in operational strategies by designing and developing data driven decision support systems. For example, Data science, machine learning, and other digital technologies can help tremendously in tracking not only the potentially affected people but surfaces that might be exposed to the covid-19.

Let’s take New Zealand as an example. In New Zealand, if a covid-19 case is detected or expected, all close contacts including family members and friends are contacted and asked to self-quarantine. Also, if a person travelled from overseas, people sitting in the proximity of this person in the plane are also asked to self-quarantine for 14 days. Most of it is based on the information given by the detected person.  This is a right thing to do. However, everyday news cases are being reported. Some of them are from unknown links or sources that is evidence that there are blind spots in the current contact tracking system.

**Figure 1. New Zealand covid-19 tracking system has blind spots**

 
Current contact tracking system in New Zealand might be missing significant segments of population who might be exposed to covid-19 via the detected person. For example (Figure 1), if you look at the journey of an example affected person, say this person came from overseas, the segment of population exposed includes:  fellow passengers exposed in the flight, staff at airport, taxi driver from airport to home, might have visited a local pub or restaurant,  family members or co-habitants etc. Current tracking system will have quite a lot of blind spots such as visits to the local restaurant, or petrol station, grocery store, public toilets etc.

Data science, big-data and machine learning technologies could offer tremendous help in not only tracking the directly exposed people to the detected cases, but to precisely locate the exposed surfaces. Tracking exposed surfaces is important as there are numerous reports that covid-19 could stay alive on the surface from a few hours to days depending on the type of the surface.

Although we in New Zealand might not have widespread camera surveillance, almost everybody (over 99% adults in New Zealand) carry their cell-phones around with them. Cell-phone location data is collected by the telecom and mobile service providers for their operational purposes (Vodafone, Spark and 2 degrees in NZ). From my previous experience working with this type of data I know this rich data source has huge potential in tracking location and paths taken by people. We can find where detected patients have been in the last two weeks. Other potential data sources are trip planes from Google maps, and social media such as location information from Facebook and Twitter.

How it might work? We should be able to generate a journey map for a covid-19 positive or probable cases individually with detailed timelines. Say a person A was at the restaurant X at 7:00 pm on 10/03/2020. We should be able to find out all other cell phones (as a proxy to the people) present at the restaurant X for 24 hours after 7:00pm on that date. Similarly, a detailed map of all other places and people that might be exposed to covid-19 via this case should be created and followed up.

I understand that in normal times this type of data is highly private and confidential and should not be released for any other purpose. However, as Sir David Skegg mentioned in his article (NZ’s Covid response: We need to be more open), New Zealand, like the rest of the world, is facing an unprecedented challenge that requires urgent decisions. Also, this data is already used in certain situations for example in criminal cases investigation and marketing. Rapid case contact tracing could be expanded quickly and enhanced using data science and other digital technologies. This data has potential to save lives. I am sure for the benefit of the whole community, people and companies will be willing to cooperate. In my view, we should explore every possible option to go early and go hard on stopping the spread of covid-19. Take action now otherwise it will be too late.
