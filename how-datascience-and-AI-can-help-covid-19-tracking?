How data science can help tracking covid-19?

Rigorous, and complete tracking and tracing of the COVID-19 is critical in designing strategies and operation to fight the spread of covid-19. Data science, machine learning and other AI and digital technologies can help tremendously in tracking not only the people but surfaces that might be exposed to the covid-19 by tracking precisely and in real-time where the covid-19 patients has been for last two weeks. 

These days almost everybody (over 99% in New Zealand) carry their cell-phones and Cell phone location data is collected by the telecom and mobile service providers for their operational purposes. This rich and real-time data is has huge potential in tracking places and people on the paths and locations where detected patients have been in last two weeks. Other potential data sources are Google maps, and social media such as Facebook and twitter.
I understand that in the normal times this type of data is highly private and confidential should not be release for any other purpose. 
However, This is unpredicted and difficult time in the history of the human kind and considering the potential of this data saving not only lives but potential economics damage, I am sure people and companies will be willing to cooperate.

How it might work?
