Rigorous, and complete tracking and tracing of the COVID-19 is critical in designing stragies and operation to fight the spread of covid-19.
Data science, machine learning and other AI and digital technologies can help tremendously in tracking not only the people but surfaces that 
might be exposed to the the covid-19 by tracking precisly and in real-time where the covid-pateients has been for last two weeks. 
These days almost everybody (over 99% in New Zealand) carry thier cell-phones and Cell phone location data is collected by the 
telecome and mobile service providers for thier operational purposes. This rich and real-time data is has huge potentiol in tracking 
places and people on the paths and locations where detected patients have been in last two weeks.Other potentiol data sources are google maps, 
and social media such as Facebook and twitter.
I understand that in the normal times this type of data is highly private and confidential should not be release for anyother purpose. 
However, This is unpredented and difficult time in the history of the human kind and considering the potentiol of this data saving not only lives but 
potentiol econmics damage, I am sure people and comapnies will be willing to cooperate.

How it might work?
